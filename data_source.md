### Compiling a knowledge resource

For your test set and the RAG systems, you will first need to compile a knowledge resource of relevant documents. We have provided a **baseline knowledge resource** that you may use as a starting point. You can build on top of this baseline by adding new sources and expanding coverage. You are free to use any publicly available resource, but we highly recommend including the websites below. Note that we can also ask you questions from relevant subpages (e.g. "about", "schedule", "history", "upcoming events", "vendors", etc.) from these websites:
